Getting feedback is easy. Getting *useful* feedback? That's the challenge.

Most products drown in feature requests, support tickets, and vague suggestions. Here's how to cut through the noise and collect feedback that helps you build better products.

## The problem with most feedback

"Can you add dark mode?"
"Your app should integrate with [obscure tool]."
"I'd love it if you could just..."

Sound familiar? Most feedback falls into two camps:

1. **Solution requests** - Users telling you what to build
2. **Vague complaints** - Users telling you something is wrong, but not what

Neither helps you understand the underlying problem.

## Better feedback starts with better questions

Instead of asking "What features do you want?", try:

- **What are you trying to accomplish?**
- **What's frustrating about your current workflow?**
- **When was the last time you gave up on a task?**

These questions reveal the *why* behind requests.

## Let users vote, but don't blindly follow

Voting systems like shipped.fyi help you see patterns. If 50 users vote for the same feature, that's a signal. But votes alone don't tell the whole story.

A feature with 10 votes from paying customers might matter more than one with 100 votes from free users. Context matters.

## The feedback loop

The best feedback systems are two-way:

1. **Collect** - Make it easy to submit ideas
2. **Acknowledge** - Let users know you heard them
3. **Update** - Share what you're working on
4. **Close the loop** - Notify voters when features ship

This builds trust. Users who feel heard become advocates.

## Start simple

You don't need a complex system. A simple feedback board where users can submit ideas and vote is enough to get started.

The key is consistency: regularly review feedback, update your roadmap, and communicate what you're building.
