We've added categories to help you organize your feedback boards.

## What's new

You can now create categories to group related feedback items. Use them to:

- Separate feedback by feature area (UI, Performance, Integrations)
- Organize by product line or module
- Tag items by priority or theme

## How it works

1. Go to your project settings
2. Create categories with custom names and colors
3. Assign categories to feedback items

Categories appear as colored badges on your feedback board, making it easy to scan and filter.

## Why this matters

As your feedback grows, finding patterns becomes harder. Categories help you spot trends and prioritize by area.
