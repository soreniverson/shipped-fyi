We're excited to announce that shipped.fyi is now live!

## What is shipped.fyi?

A simple tool to collect feedback, share your roadmap, and keep users in the loop about what you're building.

## Why we built this

Most feedback tools are built for enterprise teams with complex workflows. We wanted something simple that works for indie hackers and small teams.

## Key features

- **Feedback boards** - Let users submit and vote on feature requests
- **Public roadmaps** - Show users what you're working on
- **Changelogs** - Celebrate what you've shipped
- **Embeddable widgets** - Add feedback collection to your app
- **Email notifications** - Let voters know when features ship

## What's next?

We're just getting started. Follow our [updates](/updates) to see what we ship next.
